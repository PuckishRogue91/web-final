                    <p>My eldest dog, Chloe. Chloe is a 9 year old Jack Russell rescue from our small Texas hometown. She enjoys ruling the house, eating treats, and barking at the Amazon delivery driver.
                        She believes that she is much larger than she actually is, and her breath is stinky no matter how many dental sticks she gets to chew on.

                    <p>Luke is a Shih-Tzu Poodle mix. He is 7 years old. He loves his father and tolerates me as a co-habitant of our home. He loves screaming, torturing groomers, and hating his siblings.
                        He is not a fan of the snow; however, when I tried to put him in a sweater, he bit me. Not hard or anything, but I got the message.

                    <p>Kira is the quietest Siberian Husky mix to have ever lived. Unless she needs to go to the restroom, she cannot be bothered to carry on a conversation. She is 6 years old, and a rescue from the Austin Animal Shelter.
                        She is pictured here with the baguette she stole from me when I was trying to put away the cheese plate.

                    <p>Poe is the baby at 5 years. Another rescue from our hometown. He is a hardcore mama's boy, and high maintenance to boot! Not to mention an unmatched jealous streak. He gets spoiled
                        due to his health conditions, which give him occasional seizures. He is the one dog on the planet that is not a fan of my sister, much to her annoyance.
